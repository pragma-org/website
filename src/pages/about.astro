        PRAGMA is a member-based, not-for-profit Open Source Association for
        blockchain software projects. It aims to foster an alternative
        open-source ecosystem for Cardano and beyond. Said differently, we are a
        team of passionate software engineers from various backgrounds who build
        open-source tools for developers aiming for mass adoption.

          PRAGMA's primary goal is to foster an open-source ecosystem for
          Cardano by hosting existing projects and helping them to thrive.
        </li>

          It also aims at facilitating the development and emergence of new
          meaningful tools where needed.
        </li>
        <li data-counter="3">
          In a sense, PRAGMA is about democratising software development for the
          Cardano ecosystem and in the long run in blockchain as a whole, using
          proven open-source methodologies.

          We want to give an opportunity for <i>anyone</i> to contribute to the development
          of key projects in Cardano -- <i>and beyond</i>.

      id="our-principles">
      <p class="justified">
        We want to build software solutions that increase blockchainâ€™s utility
        and adoption, inasmuch as they also provide business value for ecosystem
        actors. We want to give an example of a decentralised and transparent
        organisation dedicated to developing blockchain infrastructure, starting
        with Cardano. We aim to deliver solutions in small steps and build a
        structure to help support and incubate other projects in the long run.
      </p>
      <p class="justified">
        <span class="highlight"
          >We believe that an open-source alliance between multiple capable
          actors is necessary to carry this mission.</span
        > An endeavour of that magnitude, maintained through the years, is only possible
        via an efficient and collective open-source strategy. PRAGMA materialises
        a common vision between amicable and like-minded organisations who have already
        been successfully working together on many occasions. PRAGMA is therefore
        an attempt to consolidate forces and propose a model of operations that others
        may choose to follow.
