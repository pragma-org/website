        PRAGMA is a member-based, not-for-profit Open Source Association for
        blockchain software projects. It aims to foster an alternative
        open-source ecosystem for Cardano and beyond. Said differently, we are a
        team of passionate software engineers from various backgrounds who build
        open-source tools for developers aiming for mass adoption.

          PRAGMA develops high-quality software that serve the public good and
          are freely available, emphasizing accessibility, inclusivity, and
          societal impact.
          <br /><br />
          We build enduring and impactful projects designed for long-term sustainability,

          PRAGMA fosters collaborative innovation and transparency by
          establishing an open-source ecosystem for blockchain software
          projects, promoting community-driven development and shared expertise.
          <br /><br />
          We want to give an opportunity for <i>anyone</i> to contribute to the development
          of key projects in Cardano <i>and beyond</i>.
        </li>
        <li data-title="Inspire" class="justified">
          In a sense, PRAGMA is about democratising software development for the

          proven open-source methodologies.
          <br /><br />
          We hope to build a path that others may be inspired to follow, and continuously
          learn along the way how to best support the ecosystem.

      <p class="justified">
        We want to build software solutions that increase blockchainâ€™s utility
        and adoption, inasmuch as they also provide business value for ecosystem
        actors. We want to give an example of a decentralised and transparent
        organisation dedicated to developing blockchain infrastructure, starting
        with Cardano. We aim to deliver solutions in small steps and build a
        structure to help support and incubate other projects in the long run.

          actors is necessary to carry this mission.</span
        > An endeavour of that magnitude, maintained through the years, is only possible
        via an efficient and collective open-source strategy. PRAGMA materialises
        a common vision between amicable and like-minded organisations who have already
        been successfully working together on many occasions. PRAGMA is therefore
        an attempt to consolidate forces and propose a model of operations that others
        may choose to follow.

      id="structure">
      <p class="justified">
        In its initial phase, PRAGMA is setup as a multi-headed association
        where each member has a voice. The founding members constitutes the
        <strong>General Assembly</strong> and have ultimate authority on the strategy
        and functioning of the association.
      </p>
      <p class="justified">
        The <strong>General Assembly</strong> operates through the means of an
        <strong>Administrative Board</strong> who is <i>effectively</i> running the
        operations. A crucial mission of the board is to decide on projects and appoints
        <strong>Maintainer Committees</strong> to them. The committees are small
        group of skilled software engineers in charge of developing and managing
        projects in collaboration with their respective open-source communities.
      </p>
      <img src="/img/pragma/structure.svg" alt="PRAGMA's structure" />
      <p class="justified">
        Each project is supervised by a <strong>Maintainer Committee</strong>,
        who is both responsible for the core development but also for managing
        contributions. It is in touch with the project's community, and can
        onboard motivated contributors when necessary.
      </p>
      <p class="justified">
        The <strong>Maintainer Committees</strong> are self-organising in ways that
        may differ from a project to another, for every project is different. While
        all strongly committed to the PRAGMA's principles, they may freely chose
        tools and processes that better serves the project.
