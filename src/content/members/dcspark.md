Crypto ecosystem builders, building high-quality crypto products that unify the user experience within blockchain ecosystems.

dcSpark believes that an alternative node implementation is vital to unblocking Cardano adoption, particularly when it comes to layer-two infrastructures. dcSparkâ€™s founders have been involved in Cardano since its inception and have deep, extensive knowledge of its internals as well as a strong reputation in the ecosystem. Through projects like [Milkomeda](https://www.milkomeda.com/) and [Flint](https://flint-wallet.com/), they have also explored EVM chains extensively. Their focus is now on Zero-knowledge solutions, as well as contributing to a strong foundation for gaming in Web3 through their contributions to the [Paima Studios](https://www.paimastudios.com/) game engine.
