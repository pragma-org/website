An infrastructure development company creating high-quality, highly-available open-source software and bespoke solutions on the Cardano blockchain.

Blink Labs has a long history of building and advocating in Open Source, including prior experience governing decentralised open-source bodies (e.g. [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), etc.). They comprised of seasoned infrastructure experts with experience building large private cloud and data processing infrastructure at global scale for some of the biggest names in Silicon Valley. They are bridging the gap by bringing this expertise from Web2 to Web3 and Cardano. Now focused on building out a [Go](https://go.dev/) ecosystem for Cardano from the ground up, with the goal of creating an alternative node implementation.
