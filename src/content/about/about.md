  **PR*A*GMA** is a member-based, not-for-profit Open Source Association for
  blockchain software projects. It aims to foster an alternative open-source
  ecosystem for Cardano and beyond. We are a team of passionate software
  engineers from various backgrounds who build open-source tools for developers
  aiming for mass adoption.
whoWeAreParagraph:
  - title: >-
      PRAGMA focuses on delivering perennial open-source software for the public
      good.
    text: >
      It is a cooperative effort among organisations with a similar outlook and
      mindset regarding Open Source and the blockchain industry. Each of its
      founding members is an entity deeply focused on IT development and
      engineering in the Cardano ecosystem.

      PRAGMA provides a space of common practices and high-quality standards,
      strongly focused on developer experience.
    text: >
      It is an invitation to developers who fancy building in the open as well
      as collaborating to reconcile adoption and software excellence. In the
      long run, we hope it can become a home to any blockchain-related
      open-source projects that seek collective ownership.

    text: >
      PRAGMA develops high-quality software that serve the public good and are
      freely available, emphasizing accessibility, inclusivity, and societal
      impact.



      We build enduring and impactful projects designed for long-term
      sustainability, ensuring that contributions have a lasting positive effect
      on open-source communities.
  - title: Help
    text: >
      PRAGMA fosters collaborative innovation and transparency by establishing
      an open-source ecosystem for blockchain software projects, promoting
      community-driven development and shared expertise.



      We want to give an opportunity for anyone to contribute to the development
      of key projects in Cardano and beyond.
  - title: Inspire
    text: >
      PRAGMA is about democratising software development for the Cardano
      ecosystem and, in the long run, in blockchain as a whole, using proven
      open-source methodologies. We want anyone to have the opportunity to
      contribute to the development of key projects in Cardano -- and beyond.



      PRAGMA aims to consolidate forces and propose a model of operations that
      others may choose to follow.
principlesTitle: 'Simplicity, transparency and efficiency.'
principlesFirstParagraph: >
  We want to build software solutions that increase blockchainâ€™s utility and
  adoption, inasmuch as they also provide business value for ecosystem actors.
  We look to set an example for a decentralised and transparent organisation
  dedicated to developing blockchain software ecosystems, starting with Cardano.
  We aim to deliver solutions in small visible steps and build a structure to
  help support and incubate other projects in the long run.
principlesHighlightedParagraph: >
  We believe that an open-source alliance between multiple dedicated actors is
  necessary to carry this mission.
principlesSecondParagraph: >
  An endeavour of that magnitude, maintained through the years, is only possible
  via an effective and collective open-source strategy. PRAGMA materialises a
  common vision between amicable and like-minded organisations who have already
  been successfully working together on many occasions.

        members or contributors.
promisesParagraph: >
  While the above means that projects will need to look for other sources of
  resourcing , we believe it is paramount for the long-term success of the
  association as it will significantly de-risk, simplify and lower the costs of
  operation and make membership and contributions by members to the association
  more attractive. Most importantly, this separation will keep the association
  focused on long-term development related activities and goals.
structureTitle: 'A multi-headed association, with members operating in full-consensus.'
structureFirstParagraph: >
  In its initial phase, PRAGMA is setup as a multi-headed association where each
  member has a voice. The founding members constitutes the **General Assembly**
  and have ultimate authority on the strategy and functioning of the
  association.


  The **General Assembly** operates through the means of an **Administrative
  Board** who is *effectively* running the operations. A crucial mission of the
  board is to decide on projects and appoints **Maintainer Committees** to them.
  The committees are small group of skilled software engineers in charge of
  developing and managing projects in collaboration with their respective
  open-source communities.
structureSecondParagraph: >
  Each project is supervised by a **Maintainer Committee**, who is both
  responsible for the core development but also for managing contributions. It
  is in touch with the project's community, and can onboard motivated
  contributors when necessary.


  The **Maintainer Committees** are self-organising in ways that may differ from
  a project to another, for every project is different. While all strongly
  committed to the PRAGMA's principles, they may freely chose tools and
  processes that better serves the project.
