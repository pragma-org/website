## Foster growth in the Cardano ecosystem.

In true Open Source fashion, Aiken arose from the dedicated efforts of various individuals. After the original kickoff with the support of TxPipe on the foundational tooling, the Cardano Foundation helped in materialising the ideas behind a smart contract programming language. Both saw the potential of Aiken and how it could foster growth in the Cardano ecosystem. Over the course of its development, Aiken has rapidly grown to become one of the most loved frameworks for building smart-contracts on Cardano with many of the largest dApps migrating to it.

While Aiken-the-language has been mostly stable for a while, its ecosystem of tools keeps evolving and reshaping to ensure the best developer experience possible to its users. This is only truly achievable as a collaborative effort, with more than 40 code contributors and even more contributors providing feedback and ideas constantly. So it is only natural for Aiken to become one of the first projects hosted under PRAGMA as it already embodies the very core principles behind PRAGMA.
