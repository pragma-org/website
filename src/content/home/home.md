  PRAGMA aims to foster an alternative open-source ecosystem for Cardano and
  beyond. We are a team of passionate software engineers from various
  backgrounds who build open-source tools for developers aiming for mass
  adoption.
contributeTitle: A collective open-source strategy
contributeText: >
  We want to build software solutions that increase blockchainâ€™s utility and
  adoption, inasmuch as they also provide business value for ecosystem actors.
  By delivering solutions in small steps, we intend to involve other builders to
  create strong open-source communities. Projects under PRAGMA are open to
  contributions and will onboard those who want to get involved.
