changelog: |
  - Created a first version of the simulation environment in Haskell and then in Rust;
  - Built a set of traces and metrics to track the behaviours of the node and the various activity we want to observe for testing;
  - Built a setup where we can plug together Amaru nodes;
  - Demo made on the 27th June demonstrating all of the above: https://pragma.io/projects/amaru/
  - Forecasted activities to achieve two major deliveries: relay node & block producing node;
  - Reworked the scopes and effort needed for each scope of the project: Ledger, Consensus, Marketing, Mercenaries;
  - Recapped the information related: https://adastat.net/governances/bd488931f792651fefa9c6fda185a2c6cec83245b51d994e33090ce36e29cc2600;
  - Successfully passed the info action threshold for our proposed budget with 80.43% approval from Dreps;
  - Testing on preview and preprod functionnalities linked to governance and treasury withdrawals;
  - Started the setup of the treasury withdrawal smart contract;
  - Created [Amaru-doctor](https://github.com/jeluard/amaru-doctor): an environment to better understand what the Amaru node actually do and get information about processes running and effects;
  
# Next planned steps (new releases, significant changes, etc.)
next: |
  - Once the treasury withdrawal is voted properly secure the transactions required to get the money into the smart contract setup;
  - Implement all the relay node requirements to meet a Q3 delivery target;

# Reflection & Performance:
comments: |
  - Setup a discussion with all the information related to our recurring meeting of the Maintainer Committee: https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru/discussions/91;
  - Treasury withdrawal seems very tricky based on the preview and preprod experiment, requires a lot of knowledge and has a lot of room for human error;
