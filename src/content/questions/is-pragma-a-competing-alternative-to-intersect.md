title: Is PRAGMA a competing alternative to Intersect?
---

No. PRAGMA is a complementary effort. The mission of Intersect is broad, and the challenges they are facing are significant. With PRAGMA, we hope to start small, and figure out the most efficient way to work together. PRAGMA is also focused on open-source software development, whereas Intersect is a broader governance entity for Cardano.

In the long run, we do hope that PRAGMA and Intersect can work hand-in-hand to deliver what is best for Cardano.
