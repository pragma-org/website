title: Is PRAGMA a competing alternative to Intersect?
---

No. PRAGMA is a complementary effort. The mission of Intersect is broad, and the challenges they face are significant. PRAGMA is focused solely on open-source software development, whereas Intersect strives to be the broader governance entity for Cardano. With PRAGMA, we hope to start small, and figure out the most efficient way to work together on an initially limited number of projects.

In the long run, we hope that PRAGMA and Intersect can work hand-in-hand to deliver what is best for the Cardano ecosystem.
