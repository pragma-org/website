title: Why does PRAGMA focus on Rust?
---

First and foremost, because we seek to meet developers where they are. To successfully bootstrap an open source ecosystem, we need enthusiasts and professionals who feel comfortable in contributing. Rust has ranked as “1st most admired technology” in [Stack Overflow’s 2023 developer survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages) and it is particularly prevalent in the blockchain industry.

Second, because Rust is a language ecosystem with a solid foundation, created by [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/), supported through open governance via RFC, and now supported by the [Rust Foundation](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/) created by several IT industry leaders. Rust as a platform is massively performant and easily interoperable, with a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries. In particular, Rust is well-suited for cryptography and has excellent support for cryptography primitives.

Thirdly, Rust has a long history within the Cardano ecosystem. Starting with the Incentivized TestNet (ITN) which was powered by Jörmungandr – a Rust node, Rust has remained one of the largest sub-ecosystems on Cardano with projects such as [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.dev), [Mithril](https://mithril.network), [Oura](https://github.com/txpipe/oura), [Pallas](https://github.com/txpipe/pallas) or the [cardano-multiplatform-library](https://github.com/dcSpark/cardano-multiplatform-lib).
