title: Why the focus on Rust?
---
Cardano is well-known for its functional programming affinity, with in particular the use of Haskell for the development of many of its core components. So one may ask, why Rust?

First, because we seek to meet developers where they are. To successfully bootstrap an open source ecosystem, we need enthusiasts and professionals who feel comfortable in contributing. Rust has ranked 1st most admired technology in Stack Overflow’s 2023 developer survey and it is particularly strong in the blockchain ecosystem (Polkadot, HyperLedger, Solana, Elrond, Near, O1(Labs), …).

Second, Rust is a language ecosystem with a solid foundation, created by Mozilla, supported through open governance via RFC, and now supported by the Rust foundation created by several IT industry leaders. Rust as a platform is massively performant and easily interoperable, with a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries. In particular, Rust is well-suited for cryptography and has one of the best (if not the best) support for cryptography primitives.

Finally, Rust has already a long history with Cardano. The OGs amongst the ecosystem will certainly remember the Incentivized TestNet (ITN) which was powered by a Rust Cardano node. Ever since, Rust has remained one of the largest sub-ecosystem on Cardano with projects such as Aiken, Mithril, Oura, Pallas, the cardano-serialisation-library or the cardano-multiplatform-library all developed in Rust. Even parts of the Haskell Cardano node today rely on underlying Rust crypto libraries.

In fact, Rust shares a lot with Haskell when it comes to its proximity with the academic world. It is a language geared towards correctness while remaining very pragmatic in its approach. Note that while Rust will become a language of choice within PRAGMA projects, we do also believe that the right technology for the job is the one that helps you deliver at the end. As such, there will eventually be a panel of proven technologies used under PRAGMA, not only Rust.
