title: How to become a member?
---
At the moment, membership is not open. PRAGMA has been founded by an initial committee that is fixed. While the ambition is to open PRAGMA to membership in the long-run, we first need to figure out how this can work at a larger scale by first trying with a limited number of parties.

Not being open to membership does not, however, mean that PRAGMA works in isolation and separated from the ecosystem. On the contrary, we do invite interested parties to join our effort and help us collectively build a strong ecosystem. Projects under PRAGMA are open to contributions and will onboard those who want to get involved.
