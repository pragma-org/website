title: Where does the name “PRAGMA” come from?
---

Firstly, the etymology of the word is particularly interesting. The Greek etymology refers to doing something. It conveys the practical idea that we are builders and people who want to ship software. In a more obvious manner, it’s also short for “pragmatic”/“pragmatism” which again points to the way we approach software development in general.

Second, in the software industry, a “pragma” is a way to specify extensions and options to programs. Pragmas are usually found on top of files to add new capabilities to an existing program. For example, they may enable specific language features in a compiler. So in our context, it resonates with this idea that PRAGMA is an umbrella for an alternative ecosystem that provides extensions to what exists without disrupting the established ecosystem.
