title: What are the goals of PRAGMA For 2025?
---

For the founding members, 2025 is a phase for exploring how PRAGMA adds value to the community and to its member projects. 
We bootstrapped the association with a key projects, Aiken and Amaru, in 2024. By the end of 2025 we want to have a complete process from applying to onboarding a new project. We want to start taking in applications in Q4 of 2025.
