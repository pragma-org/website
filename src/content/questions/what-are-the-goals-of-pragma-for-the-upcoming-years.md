title: What are the goals of PRAGMA for the upcoming years?

2024 is a phase about building trust and finding our marks. We want to bootstrap the association with a few key projects, and manage to reach our identified milestones. Launching such an initiative is inherently complex but we do fear the challenge.

From 2025 onwards, we should have figured out how to work together with a limited set of members. As such, it will be a good time to open membership and onboard new projects. So a key objective for 2025 will be to precisely make this a possibility.

Then, once we have a model that works for us within the Cardano community, opening up to the other blockchain ecosystems only sounds logical since given the amount of overlaps between blockchain technologies.
